GIS Theory and methods
Basic elements
	scale 
	grid
	north arrow 
	legend
	title
	projection
Types of attributes
	nominal or categorical
	ordinal or ranked (no clear relation between ranks)
	interval (clear relation between intervals, no absolute 0)
	ratio (clear relation between values, absolute 0)
	cyclic
Representations
	discrete (defining boundaries is hard - use index)
	continuos or fields
Accuracy
	maps and measurements vary on accuracy.
	UNDERSTAND YOUR DATA AND HOW WAS CREATED.
	accuracy comes with a price (trade off)
	sometimes fuzzy definitions or indexes are required
	Modifiable areal unit problem (maup)
Spatial autocorrelation (tobler's law)
	"Everything is related to everything else,
	but near things are more related than
	distant things.‚Äù
	assessment techniques:
		Geary's
		Moran's	
		Getis-Ord General G
		Local Indicators of Spatial Association
Randomness of points
	Expected model: Complete spatial randomness (csr) 
	which follows a poisson distribution.
	assessment techniques:
		quadrant analysis 
			compares with poisson using chi squared
			affected by maup
		ripley's k
Neighbours
	spatial weights matrix
Regressions
	geographically weighted regression (gwr)
Surfaces
	density
	interpolation
		polynomial
		splines
		idw
		kriging
